    <h2 class="description">Description</h2>

    <p>This is my family's favorite pancake recipe. We make them for special occasions, especially 
        birthdays, but also whenever we have a lazy weekend morning at home. 
        It is fast and easy to make. I like them best with a little bit of syrup and butter. 
        However, ours kids always want to fancy them up by adding chocolate chips or sprinkles to the batter. 
        Hope you enjoy!
