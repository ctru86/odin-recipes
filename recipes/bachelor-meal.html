    <h2 class="description">Description</h2>

    <p>When I graduated college and left the comfort of always having home-cooked meals prepared for me or a college cafeteria buffet on which to feast on, 
        I realized I didn't know how to make myself anything aside from a bowl of cereal. 
        This led me to start experimenting with combinations of things I liked. Usually they were terrible. 
        But, one day, I stumbled onto a winner by combining three of my favorite things, meat, rice, and fried eggs. Since I lived in a tiny 
        studio apartment where the fire alarm would go off at the slightest hint of smoke, I was limited to meats that just needed to be warmed up in a pan or microwave such as hot dogs, spam, or vienna sausage.
        Over time I started adding other things I enjoy including tomatoes and advocados.

    <ul>
            <li>1. Rice</li>
            <li>2. Olive or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3. Your favorite highly-processed meat including vienna sausage, hot dogs, spam, or baloney</li>
            <li>4. Your favorite toppings such as avocados or tomatoes</li>
            <li>5. Eggs</li>
            <li>6. Salt and Pepper</li>
            
     </ul>

    <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2> 
    <ol> 
		<li>-Get yourself a <strong>rice-cooker</strong>, you'll thank me later kid. Add 2 cups of rice, 4 cups of water, a little salt, and a little oil. Stir and set to cook.</li> 
		<li>-Take your preferred veggies or other toppings and dice or cut into small pieces and leave off to the side</li>
		<li>-Take your preferred meat and warm it up in the microwave or a pan then cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>-When the rice is cooked, leave the rice-cooker plugged in and on the warm setting and mix in your meat and other ingredients.</li>
        <li>-Take your pan and crack and egg or two on it. Cover the pan, ideally with a glass cover to monitor the egg.</li>
        <li>-When the egg is cooked to your liking, take a few scoops from your rice cooker onto a bowl and place the eggs on top.</li>
        <li>-Break the egg yolk and let it run through the bowl and stir. Enjoy!</li>
